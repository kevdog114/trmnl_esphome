# Trmnl ESPHome examples

This contains some working esphome yaml files that work with the trmnl e-ink device. You can easily flash esphome onto the trmnl device
as they use an esp32 device.

Specific pins that the trmnl uses are defined in their firmware repo: https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware

Also, I'm not afiliated with trmnl, and I have no idea if they periodically change the hardware, so follow along at your own risk.
